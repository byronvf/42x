Mac version: implement print-out window.
Modify the file selection dialogs so they have a file type menu, and add
extensions to file names automagically when appropriate.
Pressing Command-N, or any Command-key combination that isn't defined in the
menu, causes Free42 to act as if the key were pressed without Command, and
never released... after which, the keyboard is unresponsive to mouse clicks,
and you need to press some other keyboard key to unfreeze it.

iPhone version: implement print-out window.
Implement program import/export to local files.
Implement pop-up keyboard for ALPHA mode text entry.
Implement copy & paste.
Implement URL decoding for HTTP requests (filenames with spaces, etc.)

Motif version: activating the Skin menu by clicking on it, as opposed to the
old-Mac-style press-hold-drag-release cycle, often causes a crash.
Could be a Lesstif bug: the Mac build appears immune, and it uses OpenMotif,
while the Linux (FC6) and Cygwin builds crash, and they use Lesstif.
Sounds like some evil interaction with the callback I use to populate the menu;
maybe Lesstif just doesn't like me repopulating the menu in the map callback.

iPhone version: it is possible to disable the sleep timer using
[UIApplication sharedApplication].idleTimerDisabled = YES;
This would be a good thing to use to prevent auto-poweroff while a program
is running.

iPhone version: leaving the HTTP Server doesn't always manage to close the
server socket. The result can be (1) reopening the HTTP Server fails to bind
the socket to the desired port, or (2) the app hangs, presumably while trying
to connect to the socket to tell the server to shut down. In both cases, the
server loop appears to be hanging, which in turn must have something to do
with the fact that it handles all connections on a single thread: when handling
one connection never terminates for whatever reason, all subsequent operations
either fail (case #1, above) or hang (case #2, above).

PalmOS: Flag 11 doesn't work on power cycle: After exit and restart, it does
work; after power cycle, the "running" annunciator comes on, but the program
does not actually run. Sounds like the event queue needs to be prodded.

The whole flag 11 thing seems flaky on several platforms.
Also, what about  LBL "NASTY"  SF 11  OFF  GTO "NASTY"  ?
I think we should have some kind of check for the case where the calc does OFF
without ever having handled any kind of user events since power-on; it should
either refuse to power off, or clear flag 11 before powering off, or do some
kind of user interaction to give the user a chance to break this potentially
inescapable cycle.

Add keyboard click option for the Pocket PC version.

Add a feature for importing and exporting variables from and to CSV files.
