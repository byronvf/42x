Free42 has benefited tremendously from, and probably wouldn't even exist today
if it weren't for, these excellent pieces of Free Software: PRC-Tools by
D. Jeff Dionne, with multi-segment debugging support by Ton van Overbeek; Peal
by Greg Parker; Vim by Bram Moolenaar; DDD by Dorothea Luetkehaus and Andreas
Zeller; NetPBM by Jef Poskanzer and others; gcc/g++ by Richard Stallman and
others; gdb, binutils, and too many other fine tools to name, by the Free
Software Foundation and its contributors; and the Linux kernel by Linus
Torvalds and others.

Many thanks to all concerned for the help and advice I received from many
contributors to several Usenet newsgroups and various mailing lists.

And of course, kudos to the inspiration for it all, the excellent HP-42S
calculator by Hewlett-Packard.

A big and continuing Thank You to all the many people whose names I did not
record, who have sent me bug reports, words of encouragement, and donations.
