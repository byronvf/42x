I keep all the common files in the 'common' directory. In order to build the
Windows version, you must first copy these files from 'common' to 'windows'
using the copy-files script; if you modify any of them, you must copy them
back using the copy-back script before committing the changes to CVS.

Note: the Free42 workspace contains four projects: Free42Binary, Free42Decimal,
keymap2cpp, and skin2cpp. Before building Free42Binary and Free42Decimal, you
must build keymap2cpp and skin2cpp and run them; this creates the keymap.cpp
and skins.cpp files, which contain the default keymap and the skins to be
compiled into the Free42 executable.

As an alternative, you can also build the Windows version using MinGW.
Run copy-files to get the stuff from the 'common' directory; then say
'make' to build the binary version, or 'make -e BCD_MATH=1' to build the
decimal version. Note that the /mingw/bin directory must be ahead of /usr/bin
in PATH in order to run the MinGW versions of g++ etc. instead of the usual
Cygwin versions.
To build debug versions, add "-e CFG=Debug" to the make command.
