/* shell_blitter()
 *
 * Callback invoked by the emulator core to cause the display, or some portion
 * of it, to be repainted.
 *
 * 'bits' is a pointer to a 1 bpp (monochrome) bitmap. The bits within a byte
 * are laid out with left corresponding to least significant, right
 * corresponding to most significant; this corresponds to the convention for
 * X11 images, but it is the reverse of the convention for MacOS and its
 * derivatives (Microsoft Windows and PalmOS).
 * The bytes are laid out sequentially, that is, bits[0] is at the top
 * left corner, bits[1] is to the right of bits[0], bits[2] is to the right of
 * bits[1], and so on; this corresponds to X11, MacOS, Windows, and PalmOS
 * usage.
 * 'bytesperline' is the number of bytes per line of the bitmap; this means
 * that the bits just below bits[0] are at bits[bytesperline].
 * 'x', 'y', 'width', and 'height' define the part of the bitmap that needs to
 * be repainted. 'x' and 'y' are 0-based coordinates, with (0, 0) being the top
 * left corner of the bitmap, and x coordinates increasing to the right, and y
 * coordinates increasing downwards. 'width' and 'height' are the width and
 * height of the area to be repainted.

 * value of 0 signifies the end of input.

 * implementation of shell_low_battery(), it can leave the decision on how to

 * manner, using the real-time clock or some other source of randomness.
 * Note that distribution is not very important; the value will only be used to
 * seed the RNG. What's important that using shell_random_seed() guarantees

 * applications like games where you don't want the same sequence of cards

 * return 0; a return value of 1 indicates success (though not necessarily
 * accuracy!).
 *
 * The units used here match those on the iPhone; implementations on other
 * platforms should transform their units to match iPhone conventions. This
 * probably won't be an issue in practice, since the iPhone's units match
 * established international standards, the one exception being acceleration,

 * in portrait orientation, positive x points to the right, positive y points
 * up, and positive z points toward the user.
 * shell_get_location: lat and lon are in decimal degrees, with N and E
 * positive; lat_lon_acc, elev, and elev_acc are in meters. TODO: what is
 * elev relative to?
 * shell_get_heading: mag_heading and true_heading are in decimal degrees,
 * along the y axis (using the same coordinate system as described above),
 * with 0 being N, 90 being E, etc., acc is in decimal degrees, and x, y, and z
 * are magnetic deviation (again using the same coordinate system as above),
 * in microteslas, but normalized to the range -128..128. TODO: What's this
 * "normalization"? I hope they mean "clipped", because otherwise you wouldn't
 * have a unit, yet they claim the unit is microteslas.
