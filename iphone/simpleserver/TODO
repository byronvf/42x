* I uploaded a 400 kilobyte jar file to my iPod; the upload appears to have
  been successful, the file appears in directory listings and has the right
  size. However, downloading it back to the Mac fails; the connection is closed
  after about 170 kilobytes. What's going on?
* Figure out a way to separate the Free42 stuff from the generic HTTP server
  (or application server) stuff.
* For "GET /memory/<num>", you can use a "Content-Disposition: attachment;
  filename=blah.raw" header to prevent the default filename from being <num>.
* I'm currently closing the client socket using shutdown(SHUT_WR), which avoids
  the 'connection reset' mess that was happening with shutdown(SHUT_RDWR) and
  with close(). But is it correct? Am I leaking sockets now?
  UPDATE: It appears to be incorrect, and that I am leaking sockets now; read
  carefully the explanation about 4xx response codes in RFC 2616, section 10.4.
* How about support for web-based mkdir, rmdir, and rm -rf?
* Implement HEAD, and return Last-Modified for all successful requests.
* Implement If-Modified-Since handling in GET and HEAD.
* Request methods OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, and CONNECT should all return
  501 Not Implemented (N.B. RFC 2616 only *requires* GET and HEAD.)
  Any request method other than those and GET, HEAD, and POST, should return
  400 Bad Request. The same should also be returned for any request that cannot
  be parsed at all.
* The server does not seem to handle pathnames with spaces correctly. For
  example, try "/Library/Application Support" on the iPod.
* Can we run the server at port 80 on the iPod? If not, how about something
  cute like 4242?
* Get the version number compiled into simpleserver.c by using substitution
  using sed, and add a Run Script build phase to perform the substitution. The
  same mechanism could also be used to get the version number displayed in the
  Options window.
* http_error() should return a response body -- right now, whenever the server
  reports a 404 or any other error, a Firefox user will only see a blank
  screen. Maybe other browsers are more helpful, but this is bad behavior
  regardless.
