* I'm currently closing the client socket using shutdown(SHUT_WR), which avoids
  the 'connection reset' mess that was happening with shutdown(SHUT_RDWR) and
  with close(). But is it correct? Am I leaking sockets now?
  UPDATE: It appears to be incorrect, and that I am leaking sockets now; read
  carefully the explanation about 4xx response codes in RFC 2616, section 10.4.
* How about support for web-based mkdir, rmdir, and rm -rf?
* Implement HEAD, and return Last-Modified for all successful requests.
* Implement If-Modified-Since handling in GET and HEAD.
* Request methods OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, and CONNECT should all return
  501 Not Implemented (N.B. RFC 2616 only *requires* GET and HEAD.)
  Any request method other than those and GET, HEAD, and POST, should return
  400 Bad Request. The same should also be returned for any request that cannot
  be parsed at all.
