OK, I'm now closing the client socket using shutdown(SHUT_WR), which avoids the
'connection reset' mess that was happening with shutdown(SHUT_RDWR) and with
close(). But is it correct? Am I leaking sockets now?
Also, I'm not closing the server socket at all right now.
How about support for web-based mkdir, rmdir, and rm -rf?
In all of this, the /icons directory should be protected.
