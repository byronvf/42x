This directory contains the source code for the math part of MathLib (not the
shared-library bits), which in turn is from Sun's libfm and GNU libm.
This code is here for the ARM version of Free42 Binary for PalmOS. The 68K
version uses MathLib, but for the ARM version, that would be a performance
killer -- if you're going the ARM-native route, it makes more sense to compile
the FP code as ARM code, too. This adds about 100 kilobytes to the executable,
but it's worth it because of the speed boost.
