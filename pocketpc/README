To build Free42 for PocketPC, first open a Cygwin bash shell and run
'copy-files'; this will copy the required files from the 'common' directory to
the 'pocketpc' directory. Next, run 'make'; this compiles and runs the skin2cpp
and keymap2cpp programs, which take care of compiling skins and keyboard map
into the executable.

If you modify any of the files from 'common', you must copy them back using the
copy-back script before committing to CVS.

Once these preparations are done, you can run eMbedded Visual C++. Open the
Free42.vcw workspace. This workspace contains two projects: Free42Binary and
Free42Decimal; these build the Binary and Decimal versions of Free42,
respectively.
For debugging, use the "Free42Decimal/emulator/Debug" and "Free42Binary
/Emulator/Debug" configurations; to prepare a release, build the "Free42Decimal
/ARMV4/Release" and "Free42Binary/ARMV4/Release" configurations.

Once the executables are built, run "make package" to create a zip file
suitable for uploading to the web site.
